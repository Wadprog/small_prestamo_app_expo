Hi, this is Mackenzie with ERTC Help Desk.
I'm calling to let you know the substantial business tax incentives that are still available
through the Employee Retention Tax Credit Program.
ERTC can provide business funding above to $26,000 for each W2 employee you had on staff
during 2020 and 2021.
If you qualify, we will do all of the work to submit your application without any upfront
$30,000 and a very reasonable backend fee.
The program deadline for 100% funding is quickly approaching, so it's important to get the
information and apply now to receive maximum funding for your business.
Call my personal line now at 866-245-1320 for the information and to verify your qualification.
So call 866-245-1320.
Thanks.
